//! \brief an interface to the current blockchain's state.
//!
//! Proposing a block requires access to the current chain state. A lot
//! of these mechanisms are free functions in bitcoin which are super
//! hard to control for example in unit tests. Thus this interface is
//! defined to encapsulate all that free floating stuff behind a single
//! API. Inspiration for this has been drawn from a proposed Chain
//! interface in bitcoin to separate Wallet and Node from each other.
//! See: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14437 - in particular
//! https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/45b23efaada081a7be9e255df59670f4704c45d1/src/interfaces/chain.h
