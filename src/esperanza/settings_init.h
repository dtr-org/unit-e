//! \brief Initializes Esperanza settings from command line args.
//!
//! This function can only ever be invoked once over the lifetime
//! of the application - during initialization. The idea is that every component
//! receives a reference to one settings object which is not globally available
//! in its initialization. This facilitates isolation of components (due to the
//! elimination of global state) and automatically enhances testability of
//! individual units â€“ as you can provide them with a reference to a custom
//! configuration without messing around with global state.
//!
//! \return Since the init procedure needs access to the settings in order to
//! pass references to these to components the InitSettings methods returns a
//! pointer to the Settings object. It is guaranteed to be valid during the
//! lifetime of the application. If the settings could not be read from the
//! ArgsManager or settings have already been set this function returns a
//! nullptr.
const Settings *InitSettings(::ArgsManager &args);
