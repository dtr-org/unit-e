//! \brief a component for picking transactions for a new block.
//!
//! When building a new block to be proposed the proposer has to fill
//! that block with transactions. The TransactionPicker is the component
//! which selects the transactions.
//!
//! This class is an interface.
//!
//! Currently the only implementation of the TransactionPicker is an
//! adapter to bitcoins CBlockAssembler. A conceivable alternative
//! implementation would take into account maybe a minimum transaction
//! amount (but that might also have been taken care of by transaction
//! relay policies â€“ then again a proposer might still very well include
//! his own micro transaction which would have to be tackled by a
//! consensus rule anyway and therefore would be reflected in a
//! TransactionPicker).

    //! \brief The maximum weight of the block to pick transactions for.
    //!
    //! BIP141 introduced a new method for computing the max block
    //! size which is the block weight. The block weight is defined
    //! as base-size * 3 + total_size. According to BIP141 the block
    //! weight must be less-than-or-equal-to 4M.

    //! is created. The fees are the difference of the inputs being
    //! spent and the outputs created.
