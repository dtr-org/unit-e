//! The BlockProposer is different from the Proposer in proposer.cpp.
//! That one is managing concurrency (number of staking threads),
//! availability of wallets, balance, etc. The BlockProposer is used
//! to actually propose a block once we know that we have the means to
//! do so.
//!
//! This class is an interface.

    //! This is defined in BIP34 (Block v2, Height in Coinbase).
    //! This also helps ensuring that the coinbase transaction has a
    //! unique hash, hence prevent BIP30 (Duplicate transactions) from
    //! applying.
    //!
    //! Block height is up to 2^31 which is enough to support one block
    //! every second for 68 years. This is because block height used to
    //! be signed and the signbit is now overloaded in some places to
    //! signal a coinstake transaction in various serializations of
    //! coins / UTXOs.
