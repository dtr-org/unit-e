# Maintainers

UnitE is an open, community-based project. It's open for
[contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md).

There is a team of maintainers who have write access to the repository, are
reviewing patches, merging pull requests, acting as points of contacts, and
helping to get questions and other requests to the project answered.

The maintainer team can be reached on GitHub as @unit-e/maintainers, it consists
of the following individuals (listed in alphabetical order of the GitHub
handle):

* [Aleksandr Mikhailov](https://github.com/AM5800)
* [Cornelius Schumacher](https://github.com/cornelius)
* [Stanislav Frolov](https://github.com/frolosofsky)
* [Matteo Sumberaz](https://github.com/Gnappuraz)
* [Kostiantyn Stepaniuk](https://github.com/kostyantyn)
* [Azat Nizametdinov](https://github.com/Nizametdinov)
* [Mateusz Morusiewicz](https://github.com/Ruteri)
* [Julian Fleischer](https://github.com/scravy)
* [Gil Danziger](https://github.com/thothd)

There are some areas of the code where changes might have a critical impact.
While the maintainers act as a team, these code areas need special review by
domain experts. See the [list of experts](.github/CODEOWNERS) in the GitHub
reviewer configuration. Add them as reviewers on pull requests which are
touching the respective areas, if they are not added automatically.
