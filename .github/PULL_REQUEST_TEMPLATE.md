*Thanks for contributing! Here are some hints how to create a great pull request:*

* Follow the guidelines from
  https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
* Make sure unit tests are green. Run them with `make check`.
* Make sure functional tests are green. Run them with
  `test/functional/test_runner.py`.
* Adapt documentation if affected by the pull request
* Sign your work (see
  https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-your-work)
* Add a summary of your changes and any additional context which is not in the
  commit messages to the description of the pull request (you are editing this
  right now ;-)
* Reference issues the pull request addresses, e.g. by adding a line `Fixes
  #123`.
